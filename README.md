# Off-Policy Interval Estimation with Confounded Markov Decision Process

This repository contains the implementation for the paper "Off-Policy Interval Estimation with Confounded Markov Decision Process" in Python.

## Requirements
Change your working directory to this main folder, run `conda env create --file COPE.yml` to create the Conda environment, 
and then run `conda activate COPE` to activate the environment. 

## How to reproduce results in the paper
Simply run the corresponding scripts:

1. Figure 2: `sim_robust.py` and then `plot_robust.R`
2. Figure 3: `sim_trajectory_compare.py` as well as `sim_time_compare.py`, and then `plot_comparison.R`
